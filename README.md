# Daily_News_App
I needed more information in one window. That's how I made this application that I use almost every day.
Collect API data and group it to read as easily as possible. It is written in Python with Tkinter
The application can be refreshed from the button or it can be refreshed automatically at 50sec. When I use the automatic update, I set to receive text messages with the temperature and the exchange rate, at a set time.  
 You can see a video with this app on my youtube channel - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyRzNSQ8jso" target="_blank">My Daily News App</a></p>&nbsp;</div><br /><p></p>

If I need details about the weather, I can open a new window where I can choose a city to see the weather.
